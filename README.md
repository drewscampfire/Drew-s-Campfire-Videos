# Drew's Campfire Source Code

In this repository, you'll find the code for **Manim** and **Blender** used to generate the animations found on my YouTube channel, [Drew's Campfire](https://www.youtube.com/@drewscampfire).

This project originally started as a way for me to learn the intricacies of Python as part of a bigger self-directed portfolio-building project. As you go through the files, you'll find some "terrible" code I wrote when I was still learning Python. I've decided to leave these in for my own amusement and as a record of my coding journey.
